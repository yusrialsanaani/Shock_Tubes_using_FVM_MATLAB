# Lid-driven-cavity-solver-by-MATLAB

A 2D solver to solve lid-driven cavity flow problem has been implemented here using the Finite Difference method at Re = 100. 
The discretization is performed by using a second-order central scheme in space in addition to the fourth-order RK method for time integration. 
The solution is advanced to steady state using different grid refinements starting from nx=ny=33 to 260. 

At each boundary, an appropriate one-sided second-order scheme in lieu of the second-order central scheme was used.
The simulation done using a domain size of L = 1, Reynolds number of Re = 100, Mach number of Ma = 0:1, Prandtl number of 0:71, and ratio of specific heats = 1:4, and grid points nx = ny = 33.

The results of solution at nx=ny=33 are shown in figure 1 (a) - (d).

By comparing the line plots of velocity components, this solver gives similar behavior to those results in the reference (Ghia et al. (Journal of Computational Physics, 48, 387-411 (1982))) with significant difference in the magnitude. Also, the contours are not smooth. 


By performing further refinement to the grid size with nx=ny=260, the line plots of velocity components are very similar and close to those results reported in the reference. 
Also, the contours are finer and more organized as shown in figure 2 (a) - (b).
